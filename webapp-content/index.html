					counter-app 
					</h3>
					<p>For starters, I created a basic Python application that counts the number of HTTP GET requests that were initiated.</p>
					<p>I utilized "Flask" to initialize the web server, and "request" in order to get insights about the HTTP GET requests.</p>
					<p>The application has a counter that will track the amount of GET requests (App is stateless).</p>

						Jenkins Continuous Integration
						</h3>
						<p>The Jenkins Server used in this project physically resides in a homelab in my house.</p>
						<p>A Jenkins pipeline resides together within the counter-app repo.</p>
						<p>The Pipeline uses Jenkins Poll SCM feature in order to detect changes in the repository.</p>
						<p>The Pipeline checks out the repository, builds a docker image of the application, and tags the image with the Pipeline BUILD_NUMBER, in addition to a "latest" tag.</p>
						<p>After tagging the docker image, the image is pushed to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR).</p>
						<p>The last and most important thing the pipeline does is update another repo (mock-app-infra), which contains the application helm chart.</p>
						<p>Using the "yq" (Command line YAML processor) via the Jenkins pipeline ensures that the application image tag inside values.yaml is in line with the ECR image tag. The pipeline BUILD_NUMBER is utilized here again.</p>

							EKS Deployment Using Terraform
							</h3>
							<p>Furthermore, I created a GitHub Action pipeline that utilizes Terraform to provision and configure the required resources to deploy a full-blown EKS cluster.</p>
							<p>The tfstate file generated by Terraform is stored in an AWS S3 bucket.</p>

								Continuous Delivery using ArgoCD
								</h3>
								<p>In order to provide full coverage of the CI/CD, I took a GitOps approach to update the Kubernetes application.</p>
								<p>I deployed ArgoCD on the cluster and pointed it towards the mock-app-infra repo, which contains the most updated application chart.</p>
								<p>ArgoCD ensures the application is always up to date by polling GitHub (every 3 minutes) to detect changes in the application manifests.</p>

									<h3> 
									Project Summary
									</h3>
									<p>By leveraging a multitude of DevOps tools, I successfully implemented a comprehensive Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline that harnesses the power of GitOps, cloud technologies, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and Source Code Management (SCM).</p>
									<p>This integrated approach allowed for efficient and streamlined software development and deployment processes.</p>

					Bucket Creation and Configuration
					</h3>
					<p>
						To kickstart the project, I created an S3 bucket to store the web server files,<br>
						This included uploading the index.html, images, and css files.<br>
						Additionally, in order to allow access to the S3 bucket, <br>
						 I have also configured the S3 Bucket policy for the Cloudfront distribution OAC only.
					</p>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/s3content.png" alt="" /></span>

					<h3 class="main-title">
						<img src="images/cloudfront-logo.png" alt="cloudfront logo" class="main-img" />
						Exposing the Bucket with CloudFront
						</h3>
						<p>
							Next, I wanted to make the web server publicly available,<br>
							I created a CloudFront distribution and in order to optimize costs I selected the<br>
							appropriate price class based on the geographical distribution of my target audience, primarily in Israel.<br>
							Additionally, I configured the behavior settings of the CloudFront distribution to automatically redirect HTTP<br>
							requests to HTTPS, ensuring a secure browsing experience for users.

						<h3 class="main-title">
							<img src="images/ACM-logo.png" alt="ACM logo" class="main-img" />
							SSL Certificate Creation and Validation
							</h3>
							<p>
							To provide enhanced security, I utilized the AWS Certificate Manager,<br>
							I created an SSL certificate in the (N. Virginia) (us-east-1) because it is the requirement by CloudFront,<br>
							made sure to also create an "alternate domain name" in the CloudFront distribution,<br>
							otherwise the distribution will not be accessible through domain name tomerschwartz.com,<br>
							Since my DNS records were hosted on Cloudflare, I needed to complete a DNS validation process. To achieve<br>
							this, I added the CNAME record provided by AWS Certificate Manager to my Cloudflare DNS settings. Once the<br>
							validation process was successfully completed, I applied the SSL certificate to the CloudFront distribution.<br>
							Additionally, I configured a CNAME record in Cloudflare, associating my domain (tomerschwartz.com) with the<br>
							CloudFront distribution, in order to ensure visitors could access the website using the desired domain name.

								GitHub Actions Pipeline for Automated Deployment
								</h3>
								<p>
									To streamline the deployment process and facilitate seamless updates, I set up a GitHub Actions pipeline.<br>
									This automation allowed any changes pushed to the repository to trigger automatic deployment to the S3 bucket.<br>
									I created a dedicated IAM user for GitHub to ensure the appropriate access rights. <br>
									pipeline, I generated an access key for the IAM user and added the corresponding credentials to the GitHub<br>
									This allowed the pipeline to access and update the S3 bucket whenever changes<br>
									were pushed to the repository.

								<h3 class="main-title">
									<img src="images/lambda.png" alt="lambda logo" class="main-img" />
									Streamlining contact form data
									</h3>
									<p>Moreover, I have implemented a feature that enables users to provide their contact information, which will be forwarded to me through the contact form on this website.<br>
									To achieve this, I have leveraged Lambda to process the user data from the HTML form, directing it to the Lambda function, and subsequently to the SNS topic.<br>
									This ensures that I receive the information via email or SMS. <br>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/py-func.png" alt="" /></span>

									<h3> 
									Summary
									</h3>
									<p>
										By following these steps, I successfully configured an AWS S3 bucket, leveraged CloudFront for public access,
										established SSL encryption, and implemented a GitHub Actions pipeline for automated deployment. This project
										enabled smooth and secure deployment of updates to the web server, enhancing the overall user experience.

				Golang Webserver
				</h3>

				<p>I created a Golang application utilizing the Go HTTP library to create a web server. In order to enhance its functionality, I scoured the internet for suitable web resources, such as index.html and other critical files, then customized and optimized them to my liking.</p>

				
				<h3 class="main-title">
				<img src="images/com.png" alt="com logo" class="main-img" />
				Domain Name and Deployment
				</h3>
  				<p>To make the application widely available, I acquired a domain name (tomerschwartz) through GoDaddy and deployed it to an EC2 instance in AWS under the Free Tier program. Furthermore, I implemented a Jenkins pipeline, leveraging the Poll SCM option to detect any changes in GitHub and initiate the build process automatically.</p>

				<p></p>
				<h3>AWS Lambda Function</h3>
  				<p>I have created a simple AWS Lambda function using Python. This Lambda function is designed to receive two numbers as input from the user. The function takes these input numbers, calculates their sum, and generates a result.</p>

  				<h3>AWS SNS Integration</h3>
  				<p>To enable communication and notification, I have also utilized AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service). I used Terraform, an infrastructure-as-code tool, to create an SNS topic. The SNS topic serves as a communication channel for the Lambda function.</p>

  				<h3>Publishing the Result</h3>
  				<p>Once the Lambda function has calculated the sum, it publishes the result to the SNS topic. This allows subscribers or other components of your system to receive notifications or consume the result. The use of Terraform ensures that the SNS topic is provisioned automatically and consistently as part of your infrastructure setup.</p>

				<h3>Testing the function</h3>
				<p>Run the following from a CLI and include the API gateway URL </p>
				<pre>
				<code>curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"num1": 5, "num2": 5}' &lt;API Gateway Target URL&gt;</code>
				</pre>

				<code>{"statusCode": 200, "body": "{\"result\": 10}"}</code>

				<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>🏍️ Hi there! My name is Tomer. When I'm not working, you can find me out on the road on my trusty Yamaha Tracer 700 , I love exploring new routes, feeling the wind in my face, and just enjoying the ride.</p>
				<p>🧠 Aside from my passion for riding, I'm also fascinated by psychology and figuring out what drives people. Understanding human behavior is a never-ending journey, and it's something that always keeps me curious and engaged.</p>
				<p>📺In my free time, I like to unwind with some entertainment, whether that's watching my favorite shows, like Mr. Robot  and The Office , or catching up on the latest movies and TV shows .</p>
				<p>📚Furthermore, I'm also passionate about exploring new technologies. I love the freedom and flexibility that comes with open source technology, and the ability to acquire new information from the internet. Whether it's learning a new programming language, trying out a new tool or platform, or simply staying up-to-date with the latest trends, I'm always looking for ways to expand my knowledge and skill set.</p>
				<p>💻And, I have a bit of a funny quirk: I love loud, clicky mechanical keyboards. There's just something about the sound that brings me joy (although I'm sure it annoys those around me at times).</p>
